# deku-map
deck.gl with react experiment (based off the IconLayer example from [deck.gl](http://deck.gl/#/examples/core-layers/icon-layer)

## Usage
To see the base map, you need a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/). You can either set an environment variable:

```bash
export MapboxAccessToken=<mapbox_access_token>
```

Or set `MAPBOX_TOKEN` directly in `components/Map.js`.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn
# bundle and serve the app with webpack
npm start
```
